A new type of crafting, using an anvil to forge ingots, craft tools, weapons and armours, repair and dismanlte. Select an item to craft and then hit the anvil with the appropriate hammer.

#### Usage

Add an anvil to produce different items and armours, through the use of hammers.
Deletes all normal metal crafts, so that tools, weapons and 3d_armor items are no longer craftable
by hand, but only through the use of the anvil.
Also, let iron lumps be smelted into iron ingot, not steel directly.
Steel ingots are crafted through the use of the anvil with 2 iron ingots and 1 coal lump.

#### Need to add everything else.
